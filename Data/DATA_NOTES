*_bulk.arff:    Data output by the Python preprocessor. This data is just
                full messages per feature.
*_std.arff:     Data filtered by Weka, converting the full sentences into
                a standardized bag of words model. Both training and testing
                data sets must be generated simultaneously for the sets to be
                standardized and thus work with Weka's classifiers.
*_ngram_*:      Full text corpa (filtered and lowercase) but with no stopwords
                removed. The purpose of these files is to train NGram models.
                The second "*" indicates one or more "_" delimited options:
                    lower   = all lowercase words or characters,
                    char    = characters instead of words

Scrap:
*_nostop.arff:  The old standardized files that have all the stopwords in them.
                The new std files should have stopwords removed.
