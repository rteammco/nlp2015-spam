*_bulk.arff:    Data output by the Python preprocessor. This data is just
                full messages per feature.
*_std.arff:     Data filtered by Weka, converting the full sentences into
                a standardized bag of words model. Both training and testing
                data sets must be generated simultaneously for the sets to be
                standardized and thus work with Weka's classifiers.
NGram/*:        Full text corpa (filtered) but with no stopwords removed.
                The purpose of these files is to train NGram models and
                evaluate the test data on them.



Scrap:
*_nostop.arff:  The old standardized files that have all the stopwords in them.
                The new std files should have stopwords removed.
